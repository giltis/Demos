scikit-xray-examples
--------------------
Repository for demonstrating/tutorializing scientific capabilities of 
scikit-xray.  This is a separate repository from scikit-xray because we are 
hosting scientific data next to the example scripts and, as no one likes a huge 
library, it seems sensible to separate these scientific datasets.

* [1-time correlation] (https://github.com/Nikea/scikit-xray-examples/blob/master/notebooks/time_correlation/Multi_tau_one_time_correlation_example.ipynb)
* [dpc] (https://github.com/Nikea/scikit-xray-examples/blob/master/demos/dpc/dpc_demo.ipynb)
* [Powder diffraction calibration] (https://github.com/Nikea/scikit-xray-examples/blob/master/notebooks/2014-09-15_calibration/D_estimate_demo.ipynb) Note that the tilt calculation has not yet been resolved
