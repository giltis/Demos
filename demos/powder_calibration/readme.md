@tcaswell probably has a lot of notes that would be interesting for this 
readme file.

Powder calibration demo
=======================
DISCLAIMER:  This is not a complete calibration demo yet. It is missing the 
tilt calculation

--------------
1. [D_estimate_demo.ipynb] (https://github
   .com/Nikea/scikit-xray-examples/tree/master/demos/powder-calibration 
   /D_estimate_demo.ipynb) is an ipython notebook that demonstrates the 
   powder diffraction calibration functionality that currently exists in 
   [scikit-xray] (https://github.com/Nikea/scikit-xray)
1. ``Si_STD_d204-00002.tif`` is a Silicon powder calibration standard (as you
   can probably guess from the filename) that was taken at a 
   sample-to-detector distance of 204 mm
1. ``LaB6_d500-0p72959-2Kx2K_pix200.tif`` is a Lanthanum Hexaboride powder
    calibration standard that was collected at a distance of 500 mm on a 2k 
    detector.
